# Fake-Jobpost-Detection
The repository contains detailed insight of data analysis , preprocessing training of different models for detection of fake job posts detection

This repository has 3 notebook.
1. Data_analysis.ipynb which contains the code for data analysis and preprocessing of the dataset.
2. Pre_process_train_eval.ipynb contains code for preprocessing, training and evaluation of different machine learning and deep learning models which include: LSTM, attention, GRU and CNN models.
3. THe ensemble_learning.ipynb used the models trained in 2 and applies ensemble learning to predict fradulent job posts.

The dataset is in the dataset folder which is an excel file.
The repo also has reference papers which were used as guidance for predicting fradulant job posting using the dataset and methodologies as instructed with own implementaion of different machine, ensemble and deep learning models for comparision

NOTE: Change the filepaths where necessary in the python notebooks so that the models and dataset are read and written to the correct directories
